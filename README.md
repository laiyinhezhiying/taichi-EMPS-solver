The 'initialization.py' file is used to initialize the particle state.\
'empstaichi.py' is the main program of the particle method positive solution using Taichi acceleration. \
The default is to use the CPU for acceleration. If you need to use the GPU, just change the 'arch=ti.cpu' of the main program to 'arch=ti.gpu'.
